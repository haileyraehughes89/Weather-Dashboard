# Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard

This weather application allows you to view weather forecasts for multiple cities over multiple days, helping you plan your trips and activities accordingly. It leverages third-party APIs to retrieve weather data and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS. This project focuses on building a weather dashboard that dynamically displays weather conditions for cities by making use of the OpenWeatherMap API.
